# predicting_mpg_check_overfitting

## Summary

<p>
The goal of this project is to predict "miles per gallon" (mpg) with (multiple) linear regression models and explore "overfitting" on the
training data. The machine learning work flow of splitting the data into training and test data, instantiating the linear regression model, fitting the model to the data, and do an evaluation with mean squared error and variance. The data is cleaned mostly with pandas.

<p>
The dataset used is the "Auto MPG Data Set" and is hosted by the University of California Irvine on their
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG"> machine learning repository </a>.
